Purpose:
Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

Linear Regression to Predict MPB
The analysis presented the output as below: 
I would say the slope is close to zero because the vehicle weights show 1.24 and -3.4 the mean of those two would be very close to zero.

T-Test on Suspension Coils
The analysis presented different t sample tests. Its interesting to note that the different samples provided different means of x but they were all very similar (or in the similar) range of each other which would present a low standard deviation.

This analysis was difficult to put together. For future work on this project I would ask Jeremey to present the data in a way that’s easier to analyze for all levels of the organization.
